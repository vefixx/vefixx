### Hello, my name is Artem, or **vefixx**. I'm **C#** and **Python** developer, for the most part I'm **developer of the bots**.

## About me and my projects
My bots is universal and suitable for everyone. I can write the script or bot for users, Of course it's paid.

I also have popular bot of discord, his name is **[AutoposterBot](https://youtu.be/c4wnireOCho)**, and I have my own discord server, where on this moment **650+ users** | - **[click](https://discord.gg/NCxYg7skc5)**.
And i can try write bots not only **Python**, but also on **C#**.

## Only bots? No!
I can make not only bots. In my repositories you can find other scripts, for example: **Discord messages listener**, where you connect to discord websockets and can read new message in real-time.
**And that not all!** I also create Applications on **[WPF framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/overview/?view=netdesktop-8.0)** by Microsoft. You can find them in my repositories.

## What about [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)?
**API (Application Programming Interface)** - it is my favourite. I use API, where possible. For example:
- **Discord API** - I use discord api for my create my bots, and for my scripts.
- **Telegram API** - As well for bots, and make scripts with him.
- **Other** - and i use other api. Sometimes i forced create my own api on website for my goals, because some websites dont have official api.

## My favourite program languages and IDE
- **The first language is C#**. Why? Because C# more interested for me than **Python**, but **Python also include in the top**
- **Python** - is the good language. I started with him. Thanks to him, I started my way.

My favourite IDE is **Pycharm - for Python** and **Visual Studio 2022 - for C#**

## My best projects
### Bots
- **AutoposterBot** - is my first discord bot on **Python**. This bot can post your messages in discord channels even if your PC is off. In the simple words is a bot that sends messages on your behalf by itself. **He have 1000+ users**, and discord official verification him.
- **Vmessage bot** - my second bot. **You can set up an auto-reply to private messages (DM messages)**. I have developed it recently and it is going to expand.
- **CalcBot** - This bot can help you with calculations. I create him for GTA RP players, so that can count their profits.

### Scripts and applications
- **VInfinity application (for discord)** - it is my best application in my mind that is still in development. This my most hardly project. He have open-source, and you can find source code in my repositories.
- I also have scripts on **Selenium**, where i automating things in web browser. I usually make this for self.
- I create script for [FunPay](https://funpay.com/) that for auto update lots and auto up lots. It is very useful
